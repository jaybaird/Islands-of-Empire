You can play the game here:

Here is the big pile of code for the game I've been working on for over a year. It was my first released game *ever* and my second large AS3 project I've ever undertaken.

You will need the following external libraries:

AS3Signals - https://github.com/robertpenner/as3-signals
Bit101 Components - http://www.minimalcomps.com/
GTween - http://gskinner.com/libraries/gtween/

Flashpunk is included in the source tree since at the time I was making changes to it that have now been rolled into master.
