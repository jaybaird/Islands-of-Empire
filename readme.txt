Islands of Empire

You can play the game here:

Here is the big pile of code for the game I've been working on for over a year. It was my first released game *ever*.

You will need the following external libraries:

AS3Signals - https://github.com/robertpenner/as3-signals
Bit101 Components - http://www.minimalcomps.com/
GTween - http://gskinner.com/libraries/gtween/

The assets directory has been removed since I don't have a license to distribute most of the assets. The AS3 code though I think could be useful to others.

Flashpunk is included in the source tree since at the time I was making changes to it that have now been rolled into master.

I'm releasing this code under the MIT license, so have fun :)
