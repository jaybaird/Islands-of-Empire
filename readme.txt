Islands of Empire


Here is the big pile of game code for the Armor Games' game Island of Empire I've been working on for over a year.

You'll need the following external libraries:

AS3Signals - https://github.com/robertpenner/as3-signals
Bit101 Components - http://www.minimalcomps.com/
GTween - http://gskinner.com/libraries/gtween/

Flashpunk is included in the source tree since at the time I was making changes to it that have now been rolled into master.
